- Hello! I am Akash. I'm currently a graduate research scholar.
- I’m interested in mathematics, programming and all the nitty-gritty that comes with intersection of these. 
- I’m currently learning how to implement and make advanced numerical algorithms run faster with the combination of C, Python and FORTRAN.
